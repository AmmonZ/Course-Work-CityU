** Explanation **
1. There are two lights: Light0 - Environmental Light, Light1 - Spot Light.
2. The table is constructed by cubes. 
3. The lamp is built by cylinders and trancated cones.
4. The fractal opject is generated by an iteration algorithm. It can generate 6 cubes around one center point. 
5. The animation includes a scaling operation and a rotating operation. The number of the fractal objects' iteration times is related to its size, which means its shape is changing actually.

** Simple Control **
1. Use 'w' to zoom in.
2. Use 's' to zoom out.
3, Drag the pointer to change view angle.
